# sequential-shifter
## A 3D printed sequential shifter for sim racing

Simple design with minimal hardware requirements.

*Note: Try making this with printed hardware and see how it fares.

### Pieces
- Shaft
- Shift Knob
- Center
- Side x2
- Mouinting Bracket x2

### Hardware
- M6x50mm x2
- M6x60mm x2
- M6 Hex Nuts x4 (x5 if using smooth pivot bolt)
- M8x50mm Tthis is for the pivot, get a smooth bolt if possible (what the heck is that called?)
- M8 Hex Nut
- 1/4 inch threaded rod (need to measure, but around 12 inches)
- The brackets accept mounting hardware of M6, so get at least a set of 4 for mounting the shifter
- 10x30mm die springs - yellow
- 10x13mm ball plunger x4
- Long arm switch x2
